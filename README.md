# Credit card fraud detection

Payment card fraud is a major challenge for business owners, payment card issuers, and transactional services companies, causing every year substantial and growing financial losses. Credit card fraud detection, a branch of Internet security,  increases its importance in the last years because of the spreading of transactions than in the past. 

The goal of the project is to apply different machine learning algorithms to the dataset containg transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is available at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

The information has to be analyzed exploiting the methods adopted in the [paper](https://github.com/MargheritaMusumeci/Credit-card-fraud-detection/blob/main/Utils/Comparison-and%20analysis-of-logistic-regression.pdf) provided to us: 

* Logistic Regression;
* KNN (k-nearest neighbours);
* Naive Bayes.
